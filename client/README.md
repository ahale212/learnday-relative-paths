# reactTemplate


To get started
- clone the repository
- ```npm install --no-optional```
- ```npm run build```
- ```npm start```

While developing you can use 
- ```npm run startDev``` -- this uses nodemon for hot reload
- ```npm run buildDev``` -- this uses the webpack watch to repack when changes are made


There is a branch that has react-pattern-library examples
- ```git co with-rpl-layout``` -- to try this code
